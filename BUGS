* Wrong H flag for instructions SUB, SUBI, SBC, SBCI, CP, CPI, CPC, NEG.

  Affected versions: All up to 2025-03-03

* The avr51-flash1.x linker script missed the .progmemx.* sections.
The script is used in some address-space tests in the avr-gcc
test suite.  With AVR-LibC issue #962, all constant lookup data
is placed in .progmemx, so that some tests were failing.
The test cases get -lprintf_flt from dejagnuboards avrtest.exp,
and the missing .progmemx.* input sections were orphans that
overlapped with .data.

  Affected versions: ? -- r360 (2024-06-01)

* During performance measurement, SP might be read during
a glitch.  SP is no more read during a glitch, i.e. no more
read while SP is being updated by means of OUT.
Fix a fatal error that might occor with with LOG_PERF.

  Affected versions: r150 (2014-10-06) -- r221 (2019-09-09)
