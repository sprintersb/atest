                          ============


* Support call graph generation                            r178  2014-11-13
  - -graph[=FILE]  New option to generate .dot graph


* BUGFIX of wrong SBRC / SBRS / SBIC / SBIS / CPSE         r165  2014-10-20
  skip offset introduced with SVN r157 (2014-10-11).


* The magic ports to establish program <-> simulator       r163  2014-10-19
  interaction have been replaced by the more efficient
  SYSCALLs.

  when logging. 

  - -no-syms       New option to switch that off.


* Use entry point from ELF file.                           r152  2014-10-07


* New magic LOG_PORT for avrtest_log:                      r150  2014-10-06
  (ignored by avrtest)  

  - Turn on / off logging by the simulated program.
  - Capture and print performance data.

  See README for details and examples.


* New options for avrtest_log:                             r144  2014-09-30

  - -args ...      Pass all following command options to the
                   running program ready to use as 'argc' and
                   'argv' like in any hosted program:

  - Print flags like 'CZNVSHTI' insted of hex value when accessing SREG.
  - Print instruction shortcut for CLR, LSL, ROL, TST when applicable.
  - Better log of conditional jumps and instructions dealing with bits.


* New options:                                             r121  2014-09-15

  -e ADDRESS       Use byte address ADDRESS instead of the default
                   program entry point to start the simulation.


* Support AVR Xmega                                        r92   2012-06-04

  - New executables 'avrtest-xega' and 'avrtest-xmega_log'.
  - New Xmega instructions XCH, LAC, LAS, LAT.


* New options:                                             r76   2011-06-09

  -no-stdout       Disable magic action when writing to STDOUT_PORT.
                    

* New header "avrtest.h"

  - Applications can #include "avrtest.h" in their programs or compile
    with -include "avrtest.h" to get macros for the magic ports
    EXIT_PORT, ABORT_PORT, STDOUT_PORT and STDIN_PORT.


* Add support for devices with 3-byte PC                   r52   2008-07-22

  -mmcu=ARCH       New command line option to set the architecture.
                   Valid arguments for ARCH are: 'avr51' and 'avr6'.
                   Default is 'avr51'.
