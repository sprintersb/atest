                          ============


* Support entry point from ELF file.                       r152  2014-10-07


* New magic LOG_PORT for avrtest_log:                      r150  2014-10-06
  (ignored by avrtest)  

  - Turn on / off logging by the simulated program.
  - Capture and print performance data.

  See README for details and examples.


* New options for avrtest_log:                             r144  2014-09-30
  (ignored by avrtest)  


  - -no-log        Don't log instructions as they are simulated.

  - -args ...      Pass all following command options to the running
                   running program ready to use as 'argc' and 'argv'
                   like in any hosted program:

                       int main (int argc, char *argv[])
                       {
                           /* code */
                       }

  - -no-args ...   Ignore all parameters following -no-args.
                   Set argc=0 and argv=NULL as main is entered.

* Improve log output:                                      r135  2014-09-20

  - Print flags like 'CZNVSHTI' insted of hex value when accessing SREG.
  - Print instruction shortcut for CLR, LSL, ROL, TST when applicable.
  - Better log of conditional jumps and instructions dealing with bits.


* New options:                                             r121  2014-09-15

  -runtime         Show runtime statistics of avrtest itself.

  -e ADDRESS       Use byte address ADDRESS instead of the default
                   program entry point to start the simulation.


* Support AVR Xmega                                        r92   2012-06-04

  - New executables 'avrtest-xega' and 'avrtest-xmega_log'.
  - New Xmega instructions XCH, LAC, LAS, LAT.


* New options:                                             r76   2011-06-09

  -no-stdin        Disable wait and magic action when reading STDIN_PORT.

  -no-stdout       Disable magic action when writing to STDOUT_PORT.
                    

* New header "avrtest.h"

  - Applications can #include "avrtest.h" in their programs or compile
    with -include "avrtest.h" to get macros for the magic ports
    EXIT_PORT, ABORT_PORT, STDOUT_PORT and STDIN_PORT.


* Add support for devices with 3-byte PC                   r52   2008-07-22

  -mmcu=ARCH       New command line option to set the architecture.
                   Valid arguments for ARCH are: 'avr51' and 'avr6'.
                   Default is 'avr51'.


* Support ELF executables                                  r37   2008-05-25

* New options:

  -m CYCLES        Execute at most CYCLES instructions.
                   Default is -m 0 (no limit).

  -d               Initialize SRAM before program execution.
