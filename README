================
What is avrtest?
================

avrtest is a free software simulator for the Atmel AVR family of
microcontrollers distributed under the GNU General Public License.

The main intention of avrtest is to supply a fast, easy-to-use simulator
to run the GCC testsuite for avr-gcc.  Thus, its main audience are guys
and ladies that develop parts of the AVR toolchain like avr-gcc or avr-libc.

avrtest is an instruction set simulator for AVR core families
    avr51: ATmega128*, AT90can128, AT90usb128*
    avr6:  ATmega256*

avrtest-xmega is an instruction set simulator for AVR XMEGA core families
    avrxmega6: ATXmega128*, ...

The executable that supports AVR XMEGA cores is named avrtest-xmega.
In addition to the avrtest simulator, it supports the XMEGA instructions
XCH, LAS, LAC and LAT.

In the remainder, avrtest is explained.  avrtest-xmega works similar.
avrtest does not simulate internal peripherals like timers, I/O ports,
interrupts, etc.


================
Special features
================

The simulated program can communicate with the simulator: It can write to
the host's standard output and it can read from the host's standard input.
For example, an easy hello world program for AVR could look like this:


#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    printf ("Hallo World!\n");
    return 0;
}


Compile this program as usual but link against exit-atmega128.o.
How to build that object is explained in the next chapter.  Store the
C source as hello.c and compile it with, e.g.

    avr-gcc hello.c -O -mmcu=atmega128 -o hello.elf /someplace/avrtest/exit-atmega128.o

The exit-*.o object implements stdout as a stream writing through to the
host computer.  Running the program

    avrtest hello.elf

will print something like


Hallo World!

 exit status: EXIT
      reason: exit 0 function called
     program: hello.elf
exit address: 0001a4
total cycles: 837
total instr.: 503


You can also use the respective primitive functions directly:


#include "avrtest.h"

int main (void)
{
    char c;
    
    avrtest_putchar ('Q');

    c = avrtest_getchar();
    avrtest_putchar (c + 1);
    
    return 0;
}


The avrtest_putchar and avrtest_getchar functions are defined in avrtest.h
and act like putchar resp. getchar in an ordinary, hosted program:
putchar writes a character to the host's standard output and getchar reads
a character from the host's standard input.

Compile the C source with

    avr-gcc inout.c -O -mmcu=atmega128 -o inout.elf -I /someplace/avrtest

When running the program with

    avrtest inout.elf

the simulator will print a 'Q' on the console and wait for input.
Type '1<Enter>' and the output will be


Q1
2
 exit status: EXIT
      reason: infinite loop detected (normal exit)
     program: inout.elf
exit address: 0000be
total cycles: 27
total instr.: 18


There are more functions available for program <-> simulator interaction,
see the respective sections below.


=================================================
Running avr-gcc testsuite using avrtest simulator
=================================================

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/avr-gcc-list/2009-09/msg00016.html

* Get avr-gcc, Binutils and avr-libc built from sources and working.

* Install DejaGNU, expect and TCL

* Unpack the avrtest tar file from WinAVR sources top "someplace".
  You find a link to the package at "Download Snapshot" on
  https://sourceforge.net/p/winavr/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/avrtest/

* Run

    make

  inside /someplace/avrtest which will build executables from the avrtest
  C-sources and AVR object files exit-*.o from dejagnuboards/exit.c.

* To build exit*.o modules, avr-gcc will be used.  If you want a different
  avr-gcc not found in PATH, use:

    make clean-exit all CC_FOR_AVR=/some-compiler-path/avr-gcc

* Copy /someplace/avrtest/.dejagnurc to your $HOME and change the path
  inside to point to directory where "board file" is located.
  This is dejagnuboards subdirectory of avrtest files:

    set board dir /someplace/avrtest/dejagnuboards

* Edit /someplace/avrtest/dejagnuboards/atmega128-sim.exp and replace paths
  to point to correct location of files for simulator (avrtest executable
  and exit-atmega128.o object file) or add avrtest to $PATH:

    set result [exec /someplace/avrtest/avrtest -m 2000000000 -no-stdin $prog ]

    set board_info ldflags "/someplace/avrtest/exit-atmega128.o" -Wl,-u,vfprintf ...

* Run the tests from gcc subdirectory of your avr-gcc build directory like:

    make -k check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=atmega128-sim"
    make -k check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=atxmega128-sim"

* Look in the ./gcc/testsuite subdirectory of avr-gcc build directory for
  logged results or add the -all switch to see it working 1 test at a time.

    make -k check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=atmega128-sim -all"

* You can run parts of the testsuite like this:

    make -k check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=atmega128-sim avr.exp"
    make -k check RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=atmega128-sim avr-torture.exp=pr418854.c"

Voila!


=============================================
 -q : Quiet operation
=============================================

With -q turned on avrtest will print no messages except the ones
explicitly requested by:

  - -runtime
  - LOG_U8 (X), PERF_DUMP_ALL and similar logging commands, see below.

The following exit stati will be returned with -q:

  -  0  Everything went fine.
  -  1  Target program called abort()
  -  x  Target program called exit (x)
  - 10  Program timeout as set by -m MAXCOUNT.

  - 20  Out of memory (avrtest_log only).
  - 21  Wrong avrtest usage: Unknown options, etc.
  - 22  Program file could not be found / read.
  - 23  Problem with the program file: Is too big or in wrong
        format etc.

  - 42  Fatal error in avrtest.


=============================================
 -args ... : passing arguments to the program
=============================================

All arguments after -args will be passed to the target program as if the
program was running from the command line.  This is accomplished by startup
code from exit.c located in section .init8 right before main is called.

If you have own startup code in .init8 make sure it will be located before
the code from exit.c, e.g. by appropriate order of the objects passed to
the linker or by means of a custom linker script.

The first argument (argv[0]) is the program name with directories
stripped off to save space.  The last argument argv[argc] is set to NULL.

The simulator will transfer the arguments to RAM and set R24 to argc,
R22 to argv and R20 to env so that you can write


int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    ...
}


resp.


int main (int argc, char *argv[], char *env[])
{
    ...
}


and use argc and argv as in any hosted application:  If the program under
simulation is main.elf and you run

    avrtest main.elf -args hallo "4 2"

then:

    argc       is 3
    argv[0]    is (the address of) string "main.elf" (i.e. argv[0][0] = 'm')
    argv[1]    is (the address of) string "hallo"
    argv[2]    is (the address of) string "4 2"
    argv[3]    is the NULL pointer

env is set to the NULL pointer if the program is executed by avrtest
and to a non-NULL pointer when executed by avrtest_log.

exit.c:avrtest_init_argc_argv() requests the command args to be put
starting at RAM address 0xf000.  If you prefer a different location then
simply adjust exit.c according to your needs following the source comments.


============================
-no-args
============================

will act as if no -args switch was supplied:  It skip all arguments
thereafter and sets argc = 0, argv = NULL and env as described above.


============================
 -no-log and logging control
============================

* This feature is only supported by avrtest_log and avrtest-xmega_log.

avrtest_log will log address and action of each executed instruction to
standard output of the host.  In cases where that is too much a flood of
information, you can start avrtest_log with -no-log and turn on instruction
logging by executing special commands defined in avrtest.h:

    LOG_ON;

Turn on instruction logging.

    LOG_OFF;

Turn it off again.

    LOG_SET (N);

Turn on logging for the next N instructions and then switch it off again.

    LOG_PERF;

Turn on logging during performance measurement described below, i.e.
if any timer is in a START / STOP round.

Please notice that this method of switching logging on / off is (low)
intrusive to the program.  The commands listed above are translated by
the compiler to machine instructions that might affect code generation
for the surrounding code (register allocation, jump offsets, ...).
The commands have low overhead; it's not more than an avrtest syscall.


====================================
 Logging values to the host computer
====================================

* This feature is only supported by avrtest_log and avrtest-xmega_log.

In order to get values out of the running program the following
low-overhead, low-intrusive commands might be useful:

    LOG_U8 (X);         print X as unsigned 8-bit decimal value
    LOG_S8 (X);         print X as signed 8-bit decimal value
    LOG_X8 (X);         print X as unsigned 8-bit hexadecimal value

Besides these you can use similar commands for wider values with
16, 24 and 32 bits, e.g.

    LOG_U16 (X);
    LOG_X32 (X);

etc.  Moreover, there are the following commands:

    LOG_STR (X);        log string X located in RAM
    LOG_PSTR (X);       log string X located in Flash
    LOG_FLOAT (X);      log float X
    LOG_ADDR (X);       log address X


All of these logging commands have variants that take a custom
printf format string to print the supplied value:

    LOG_FMT_XXX (F, X);    log X using format string F located in RAM
    LOG_PFMT_XXX (F, X);   log X using format string F located in Flash

!!! Please use format strings with care!  You can easily crash avrtest_log
!!! and make it raise a Segmentation Fault or other undefined behaviour
!!! by specifying a format string that does not match the value!

avrtest_log uses "double" to represent float and "unsigned int" for all
other values.  The default format strings for the vanilla LOG_XXX are:

    " %u "              for the "U" variants
    " %d "              for the "S" variants
    " 0x%02x "          for the 8-bit "X" variants
    ...                 ...
    " 0x%08x "          for the 32-bit "X" variants
    "%s"                for strings
    " %.6f "            for floats
    " 0x%04x "          for addresses


========================
 Performance measurement
========================

* This feature is only supported by avrtest_log and avrtest-xmega_log.

The simulator supports 7 independently operating performance-meters 1..7:

    PERF_START (N);

starts perf-meter N which will start capturing values of the running program
like program counter, instruction count, stack pointer, call depth, etc.

    PERF_STOP (N);

will halt the perf-meter.  Upon encountering the next PERF_START(N)
the meter will be re-enabled and proceed.  The collected values can
be dumped at any time to the standard output of the host computer by

    PERF_DUMP (N);

or

    PERF_DUMP_ALL;

This will show a summary of the extremal values for the perf-meter(s) and
reset it completely so that you can use it for a different task afterwards.
Displayed values are:

 - Stack (abs):  Values of the stack pointer (SP).
 - Stack (rel):  Stack usage relative to the starting point.
 - Calls (abs):  The absolute call depth (CALLs increment, RETs decrement).
 - Calls (rel):  Call depth relative to the starting point.

Tracking of the call depth won't work as expected for setjmp / longjmp
and similar functions that set SP to an unknown call depth.

In order to give a specific perf-meter a more descriptive name there are

    PERF_LABEL (L);
    PERF_PLABEL (L);

where label L is a C-string residing in RAM or Flash, respectively.
avrtest_log will cache the label so you can override it after PERF_LABEL.

If you want to find out what value lead to the round with mimimal or maximal
instruction cycles, the next START/STOP round can be tagged with a value:

    PERF_TAG_STR (N, STR);      Tag perf-meter N with string STR
    PERF_TAG_U16 (N, U);        ... with a 16-bit unsigned integer U
    PERF_TAG_S16 (N, U);        ... with a 16-bit signed integer U
    PERF_TAG_U32 (N, U);        ... with a 32-bit unsigned integer U
    PERF_TAG_S32 (N, U);        ... with a 32-bit signed integer U
    PERF_TAG_FLOAT (N, F);      ... with float F

Just like with LOG_XXX(), S16 and S32 are represented internally as "int",
U16 and U32 as "unsigned" and float as "double".  The default format strings
to print the tags are "%s" for string, " %u " for the unsigned versions,
" %d " for the signed ones and " %.6f " for float.

Custom format strings can be supplied by

    PERF_TAG_FMT_U16 (N, FMT, U);
    PERF_TAG_PFMT_S32 (N, FMT, U);

etc. with a format string FMT located in RAM resp. Flash.

Example:


#include <math.h>
#include "avrtest.h"

float x, y;

int main (void)
{
    PERF_LABEL (1, "resource consumption of sin()");

    for (x = 0.0; x <= 3.14159; x += 0.01)
    {
        PERF_TAG_FMT_FLOAT (1, " sin (%.5f) ", x);
        PERF_START (1);
        y = sin (x);
        PERF_STOP (1);

        PERF_TAG_FMT_FLOAT (2, " x=%.5f ", x);
        PERF_STAT_FLOAT (2, fabs (x * (1 - x*x / 6) - y));
    }

    PERF_DUMP_ALL;
    return 0;
}


Compiling as usual, linking against exit-*.o and running

    avrtest_log ... -no-log -q

produces an output like


--- Dump # 1:

The computation of sin (x) took 1029..1952 cycles (with an average
of 1720 cycles) for the 315 values it had been computed.
sin() needs 19 bytes stack space.  The maximal difference between
sin (x) and the 3rd-order approximation  x - x^3 / 6  is 2.02144
and occurred for x = 3.14000.

    PERF_STAT_FLOAT (N, F);

in the example makes perf-meter N gather statistics of float value F:
mean (expected value), standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and the
START/STOP round for which a minimal / maximal value of F has been seen.
If rounds have been tagged, the tags for the rounds that yielded a minimal
and maximal value of F are also displayed.  Besides PERF_STAT_FLOAT there
is also PERF_STAT_U32 and PERF_STAT_S32 to get statistics for (un)signed
32-bit integer values.

In the sample code from above, one is interested in the resource consumption
of the sin function.  In order to supply that function with a value x and to
store the result y, additional instructions are needed:

    PERF_START (1);
    y = sin (x);
    PERF_STOP (1);

If these additional instructions are of no interest, use

    PERF_START_CALL (N);

which only adds costs of instructions that are at a call depth of at
least 1 (relative to the starting point).  This includes costs of
CALL and RET that start / finish the function.

Make sure that the function of interest is not inlined or optimized away,
e.g. by making inputs and outputs volatile and attributing the function
with __attribute__((noinline,noclone)).  The additional overhead caused by
the volatile accesses does not matter as it is ignored by PERF_START_CALL.


==============================
 Timing data and random values
==============================

* This feature is only supported by avrtest_log and avrtest-xmega_log.

Following functions return a 32-bit value:

    avrtest_cycles();       Program cycles of simulated instructions
    avrtest_insns();        Number of simulated instructions
    avrtest_prand();        A 32-bit pseudo random number
    avrtest_rand();         A 32-bit random number

The values are "owned" by the program and are distinct from the 
counters used by performance meters or that are displayed when avrtest
terminates.  Except rand, the values can be reset to their value at
program start:

    avrtest_reset_cycles();       Set cycles of simulated instructions to 0
    avrtest_reset_insns();        Set number of simulated instructions to 0
    avrtest_reset_prand();        Reset the pseudo random number generator
    avrtest_reset_all();          Reset all of them

The simulator does not account cycles to syscalls.
